`Component#selector` and `Directive#selector` are just like CSS Selector. This means we can utilize some CSS pseudo-class
to put constraints on our `selector`, making them more robust and provide better DX to our consumers

Suppose we have the following `NgxLilGui` component that wraps the `lil-gui` library.

> To learn more about `lil-gui`, visit [https://lil-gui.georgealways.com/](https://lil-gui.georgealways.com/)

```ts
@Component({
  selector: "ngx-lil-gui",
  template: ` <ng-content></ng-content> `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class NgxLilGui implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  @Input() config: Config;
  @Input() object: Record<string, any>;

  /* ... */
}
```

To make it flexible for the consumers, we allow the consumers to use `config` OR `object` to control the `lil-gui` library.
In addition, the consumers can also use `<ngx-lil-gui>` without passing in anything. In this case, `<ngx-lil-gui>` acts as a
group of other `<ngx-lil-gui>`

```html
<ng-container #anchor />
<span #spanElement>This is a span</span>

<ngx-lil-gui>
  <!-- config object contains a dynamic HTMLElement that we can control -->
  <ngx-lil-gui [config]="config" />
  <ngx-lil-gui title="SPAN" [object]="spanElement.style" />
</ngx-lil-gui>
```

However, there's nothing to stop the consumers to use both `[config]` and `[object]` on `<ngx-lil-gui>`

```html
<ngx-lil-gui [config]="config" [object]="object" />
```

To apply this constraint, we can modify our selector as follow:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: `
    ngx-lil-gui:not([config]):not([object]),
    ngx-lil-gui[config]:not([object]),
    ngx-lil-gui[object]:not([config])
  `,
  /* ... */
})
export class NgxLilGui implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  /* ... */
}
```

Now, the consumers can instantiate `NgxLilGui` component by using `<ngx-lil-gui />`, `<ngx-lil-gui [config] />`,
or `<ngx-lil-gui [object] />` but never `<ngx-lil-gui [config] [object] />`
